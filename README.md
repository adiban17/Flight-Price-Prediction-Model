# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction

Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction project! This tool leverages machine learning to predict flight ticket prices based on various input parameters. The project is built using Streamlit for the interface and employs an ExtraTreesRegressor model for predictions.

## 🌟 Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enter flight details such as date, time, source, destination, and more to get an estimated ticket price.  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes historical flight data to provide accurate price predictions.  
- **Interactive Elements**: Choose from various airlines, stops, and additional flight information to refine your prediction.  

## 🛠️ Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adiban17/Flight-Price-Prediction-Model.git
cd your-repository
```
## 🚀 Usage
- **Enter Flight Details**: Use the form to input your flight date, time, source, destination, and other relevant details.  
- **Predict Price**: Click the "Predict" button to get an estimated flight price.  
- **View Travel Time Estimates**: Use the sidebar option to view estimated travel times for different routes.  

## 🤖 Model
The prediction model is based on the **ExtraTreesRegressor** algorithm, which is known for its accuracy and efficiency in handling large datasets. The model is pre-trained and loaded using joblib.
